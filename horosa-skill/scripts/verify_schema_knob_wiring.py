"""Every declared Input-schema field must have a consumer somewhere. Ratcheted.

A schema field is a promise to the agent: "pass this and it changes the result." v0.33.1 found
fifteen fields that kept that promise nowhere — 11 on `ElectionInput` (whose own comment cited
`electionParams.js`'s 13 keys while the fields below it matched **none** of them), 4 on
`HoraryInput` (two of which, `receptionMode`/`almutenScheme`, are names that exist in no engine
vocabulary at all), plus `zuoShan`, which upstream had already deleted as a "double ghost". They
were documented, described, and inert across three releases: the agent reads the description,
passes the knob, and the output silently ignores it while looking exactly as authoritative.

The check is deliberately blunt — a field is "wired" if its name appears anywhere outside the
schema module: `service.py`, a JS tool, a vendored engine, or the guidance/registry layers. That
over-accepts (a mention is not proof of consumption) but never over-rejects, which is the right
bias for a guard that gates every schema edit. Value-level proof is `selfcheck.mjs`'s job.

**One deliberate blind spot, and why the baseline is not empty**: fields forwarded verbatim to the
remote backend (`/chart`, `/india/*`, the ken endpoints) are consumed by name *in the upstream
astropy source*, which is not in this repo and is not on CI. They therefore appear "unwired" here
while being perfectly live. The seeded baseline is exactly that set — every one of its 25 entries
was checked by hand against the upstream tree before being baselined (e.g. `pdProjection` →
`perchart.py:821`). So the baseline means "verified live via the backend", not "known broken", and
a NEW name still fails: the promise this guard actually enforces is that nobody adds a field
without pointing at its consumer.

Baseline in `contracts/schema_knob_debt.json`; refresh with `--update-baseline` after wiring or
deleting a knob. Stdlib-only. Wired into CI.
